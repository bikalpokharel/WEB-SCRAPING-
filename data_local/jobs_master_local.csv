At the international level, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also recognize lifesaving surgical and anesthesia care including in burn care under the Universal Health Coverage component, thereby creating an obligation to expand essential emergency services. Despite national and international provisions, significant gaps remain in the realization of the right to health for burn victims in Nepal. Burn injuries remain a major public health, social, and human rights concern in Nepal, disproportionately affecting women, children, and economically vulnerable communities. Burn survivors often face long-term medical complications, disability, psychosocial trauma, stigma, and economic hardship. Despite these issues, burn prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and reintegration are insufficiently prioritized within national laws, policies, strategies, and budgetary frameworks. BVS-Nepal works to promote burn prevention and ensure protection, treatment, rehabilitation, and reintegration of burn survivors through a holistic and rights-based approach. To strengthen systemic and sustainable policy change, the organization seeks to engage a highly qualified and experienced Advocacy Consultant to lead strategic, high-level, and result-oriented advocacy initiatives at the national level. Key Advocacy Issues Key advocacy issues related to burn injuries generally focus on prevention, treatment access, long-term recovery, and survivor rights. Discrepancies in the punishment and treatment of burn- and acid-related offenses. Limited access to quality, affordable, and universal burn care services, especially for rural and economically marginalized populations. Weak regulatory oversight and inadequate safety standards in the manufacturing, distribution, storage, and use of fire-hazardous materials and equipment. Hazardous public infrastructure, including mismanaged and exposed electrical wiring, coupled with procedural and legal barriers that hinder victims of electrocution from obtaining compensation. Limited community awareness on burn prevention, safe handling of fire and electrical hazards, and essential first aid management, resulting in complications and delayed treatment. Children are particularly vulnerable to burn injuries, yet burn prevention education is not adequately incorporated into the school curriculum. Purpose of the Consultancy The overall purpose of this consultancy is to design, lead, and implement effective high-level advocacy that results in tangible policy, legal, institutional, and budgetary improvements for burn prevention and burn survivor care in Nepal. The consultancy is expected to contribute to: Increasing the visibility and recognition of burn issues at the national policy and legislative levels. Promoting informed initiatives and stakeholder engagement to strengthen legal and policy frameworks and their implementation concerning burn prevention and survivor support. Facilitating inter-ministerial consultations and dialogue to improve coordination and institutional mechanisms. Facilitating strategic advocacy efforts to guide government budget allocation toward burn prevention and care. Providing strategic inputs and lobbying for law and policy reforms to address gaps in the response to different forms of burn-related violence.

The role is fully remote and focused on managing, growing, and optimising an affiliate program across 14 key markets in Europe and beyond. The successful person will be responsible for managing existing affiliate relationships, acquiring new partners, negotiating commercial deals, and tracking performance across both casino brands. This is a hands-on, relationship-driven role suited to someone with at least three to five years of direct affiliate management experience in the online casino or iGaming industry. Who We Are Looking For This role is best suited to an affiliate professional who has worked specifically in online casino or iGaming affiliate marketing, holds active affiliate relationships in markets such as Germany, Finland, Norway, Canada, Australia, or Italy, and has experience negotiating CPA, Revenue Share, and Hybrid commission structures. The ideal person will be familiar with Anjouan and Curaçao licensing requirements and how they affect affiliate compliance, has hands-on experience with affiliate tracking platforms such as Income Access, NetRefer, MyAffiliates, PartnerMatrix, or Cellxpert, and is looking for a senior role with genuine autonomy and commercial ownership. Key Responsibilities Affiliate Acquisition & Growth Identify, approach, and onboard new affiliate partners across target GEOs. Expand the active affiliate network with a focus on high-quality, compliant traffic sources. Develop and execute GEO-specific strategies to drive player acquisition across both casino brands. Commercial & Deal Management Negotiate CPA, Revenue Share, and Hybrid deals that balance partner performance with brand profitability. Review and optimise existing commercial agreements to improve ROI. Manage affiliate budgets and contribute to financial forecasting. Day-to-Day Operations Oversee affiliate program operations across two casino brands simultaneously. Monitor affiliate performance using tracking platforms and internal reporting tools. Identify and resolve tracking discrepancies, pixel issues, and reporting inconsistencies. Ensure all affiliate activity remains compliant with Anjouan and Curaçao licensing requirements. Relationship Management Serve as the primary contact for affiliate partners, providing timely support, resources, and strategic guidance. Build long-term, trust-based relationships with key affiliates and agencies. Attend industry events and conferences to strengthen the affiliate network where applicable. Internal Collaboration Work alongside marketing, CRM, and product teams to align affiliate campaigns with broader brand activity. Share performance insights and market intelligence with senior leadership. Support and mentor junior affiliate team members where relevant. Required Skills & Experience You must have proven online casino or iGaming affiliate management experience, with active contacts across DE, FI, CA, AU, CH, AT, IT, IE, NO, PL, NZ, HU, SK, and SI. A strong understanding of CPA, Revenue Share, and Hybrid commission models is essential, along with hands-on experience using affiliate tracking platforms such as Income Access, NetRefer, MyAffiliates, PartnerMatrix, Cellxpert, or an equivalent platform. You should have a working knowledge of Anjouan and Curaçao licensing and compliance frameworks, strong analytical skills, and fluent English. Additional European languages such as German, Italian, or Nordic languages are a strong advantage. Desirable But Not Essential Experience with crypto-friendly affiliate programs. Familiarity with streamers, influencers, and media buyers as acquisition channels. Knowledge of emerging GEOs outside of Europe, and previous experience mentoring junior affiliate managers are all advantageous but not required. Frequently Asked Questions Is this role fully remote? Yes. This position is 100% remote with a requirement to be based within EU / UK What casino licenses are involved? The operator holds Anjouan and Curaçao licenses. Candidates should be familiar with the affiliate compliance requirements under both frameworks. What affiliate tracking platforms are used? Experience with Income Access, NetRefer, MyAffiliates, PartnerMatrix, or Cellxpert is required. Familiarity with any comparable affiliate management platform will be considered. Do I need existing affiliate contacts to apply? Yes. Active, established affiliate relationships in the target GEOs are a key requirement for this role — not something to be built from scratch. What commission models does the program use? CPA, Revenue Share, and Hybrid structures are all in use. The role requires the ability to negotiate and optimise across all three. Is experience with crypto affiliates required? No, but it is a bonus. The operator works across both traditional and crypto-adjacent markets. What the Role Offers A competitive base salary with performance-based bonus, full remote working with flexible hours, senior-level ownership of an active and growing affiliate program, commercial autonomy to negotiate deals and shape strategy, international scope across 14+ markets, and a collaborative environment spanning marketing, CRM, and product.

We’re building a reliable team of tutors who care about students, communicate well, and show up consistently.

Build strong relationships with students and parents * Create a comfortable, fun, and safe learning environment where students feel supported. * Communicate professionally and respectfully with families when needed (as guided by your manager). * Show up with compassion and consistency—students should feel encouraged, not judged. 5. Support incentives and celebrations * Coordinate with managers to develop student incentives and trackers. * Support celebrations, awards, and recognition moments to keep students motivated and engaged. 6. Maintain professionalism * Ensure punctuality, preparedness, and a respectful on-camera presence (when required). * Protect student privacy and follow Eldea policies and expectations. * Represent Eldea with professionalism in all communication and tutoring sessions. Additional responsibilities (as applicable) * Attend occasional trainings, check-ins, or team meetings. * Share feedback on what’s working (and what needs improvement) to help strengthen the program. * Support end-of-semester wrap-ups: reflections, reporting, and feedback collection.
